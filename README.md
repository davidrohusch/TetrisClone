# TetrisClone
My Tetris's clone attempt.
Made by using SDL2 library.
This project was made for my own educational purposes. 

# Controls
Use arrow keys and enter key.

# Build
I've messed up with the initial start of the project. I've used windows resource files to compile game assets within exe. This makes is impossible to compile it on non-Windows systems. I recomend downloading the release instead.

# Release
If you want to try the game, you can check the release page.

# Disclaimer
This was my very first SDL2 project. The name "Tetris" is licenced by Nintendo and it was used just as placeholder for my personal educational project.
