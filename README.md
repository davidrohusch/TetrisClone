# TetrisClone
Source code of my Tetris's clone attempt.
Made by using SDL2 library.

# Controls
Use arrow keys and enter key.

# Build
I messed up with the initial start of the project. I'm not actually sure how to compile it.
I've used Windows' resource file for having an easy way to compile game assets inside of the executable, so it's probably buildable only on Windows.

# Release
If you want to try the game, you can check release page. I've compiled one before I switched from Windows to Linux.

# Disclaimer
This was my very first SDL2 project. The name "Tetris" is licenced by Nintendo and it was used just as placeholder for my personal educational project.
